<h2 class="envelope-notif">To my sweetheart, Diana &lt3</h2>
<p class="paragraph">
  Valentine’s Day is a reminder of how much I love and cherish you, although
  you’re on my mind every single day. Even though we’re miles apart, I feel your
  warmth and love strongly. This letter is my way of embracing you in the
  warmest hug, and whispering how much you mean to me.<br />I miss you more than
  words could ever express, I miss holding your hand, I miss your smile, and the
  warmth you bring that makes days feel more colourful. But even in moments when
  the distance feels like too much, sadness doesn’t last long. We have a future
  to look forward to. Exploring new places, eating tasty meals, overcoming
  hurdles, seeing each other smile – all of it together. <br />Even when it’s
  rough, when the sun is not shining and everything goes wrong, we have each
  other. I want you to know that I am here for you, always. I’ll support you in
  all of your endeavours, new things you learn, and your interests. No matter
  how many miles are between us, my love for you only grows stronger. I can’t
  wait to hold you in my arms and tell you in person how grateful I am for
  having you. Until then, I’ll be counting down the days until we meet again!
  <br />Happy Valentines my love! The distance won’t last forever!
